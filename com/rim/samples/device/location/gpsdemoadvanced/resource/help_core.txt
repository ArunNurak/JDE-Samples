GPS Diagnostic is a tool to test GPS performance on BlackBerry devices.

Mode: A mode must be selected before running the test. (m) stands for multiple fix and a LocationListener is used behind the scenes. (s) stands for single fix where LocationProvider.getLocation() is used under the hood.

'SmartMode' refers to logic built into this test application. When selected, the application basically runs in MS-Based mode. It falls back to MS-Assisted for a single fix if MS-Based fails for a length of time. This improves the user experience and is recommended.

Map Location: BlackBerry Maps must be installed on the device for this to work. When selected, the BlackBerry Maps application is invoked to show the fixes on an actual map. You can also specify the zoom level used in BlackBerry Maps.

Horizontal Accuracy (meters): The horizontal accuracy (in meters) to use to determine the validity of a fix.

Pref'd Response Time: This needs to be specified in seconds. Preferred Response Time determines how much time the GPS chip will spend searching for satellites and how deep the gps search should be. Must be > 0 and < = 16.

Fix Frequency (sec): Applies to multiple fix modes only. This is the interval at which the LocationListener will try to get a fix. -1 will force the default value.

Timeout (sec): Applies to multiple fix modes only. This timeout value indicates how many seconds late the provided update is allowed to be compared to the defined interval. If it's not possible to get a new location result (interval + timeout) seconds after the previous update, the update will be made and an invalid Location instance will be returned. -1 will force the default value.

MaxAge (sec): The maxAge parameter defines how old the provided location result is allowed to be when the update is made. This allows the implementation to reuse location results if it has a recent location result when the update is due to be delivered. -1 will force the default value.

Max Invalid Time: This value determines how long this application will tolerate invalid fixes until a LocationProvider reset is performed. Recommended value for this is 300.

Verizon?: If selected, the application will allow the user to enter a Verizon Client ID and password. Other CDMA carriers require a PDE IP and a PORT.

PDE IP: The IP address of the PDE server.

PDE Port: The port of the PDE server.

Client ID: Client ID provided by Verizon.

Password: Password provided by Verizon.

Current Mode: Displays the mode of the last valid fix.

Total Updates: Number of updates received in the current test run.

Assisted Updates: Number of assisted updates received in the current test run.

Unassisted Updates : Number of unassisted updates received in the current test run.

Valid Updates: Number of valid updates received in the current test run.

Invalid Updates: The number of updates in which the Location object had invalid coordinates.

Location: Coordinates of the last valid fix.

Last Valid Fix: Time of the last valid fix.

Last Reset: Time of the last LocationProvider reset.

Log: Logs generated by this application. Only the last 1000 charectars are displayed here. The complete log should appear in the eventlog which can be displayed by pressing ALT+LGLG from the BlackBerry device home screen.
